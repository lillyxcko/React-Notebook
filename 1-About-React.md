### DOM Handling
#### What is DOM? 
When a web page is loaded in your browser, the HTML code is used to create a tree-like structure called a Document Object Model (DOM). 
It allows you to change the page content in response to user interaction. 
While you can do this perfectly in Vanilla Javascript, it can quickly become challenging to manage and adversely impact performance when frequent changes are made. 
You may recongize DOM handling in V. JS as using methods like `document.createElement` or `element.appendChild`. 

Using React, you no longer need to directly query and update DOM elements in your code. The code is instead structured in "Components", 
and the DOM elements are created and updated behind the scenes. 

The results are reuseable, module, and better organized code!
